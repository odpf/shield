# Permissions

Permissions represent rules that define what actions or operations a user or identity can perform on specific resources. Permissions help enforce security and access control by governing the level of access granted to individuals or groups.

Each predefined permission has a specific purpose and grants a defined level of access to a particular resource or service. By assigning these permissions to users, groups, or service accounts, administrators can effectively control and manage access to an organization resources.
Permissions are assigned to roles such that each role is essentially a group of permissions. Each user has one or more roles that define what the user can do.

Each Shield deployment is populated with predefined permissions which allow users to perform common operations such as listing, getting, creating, updating, and deleting entities at different levels of the platform's hierarchy. They also include more specialized permissions like role management, policy management, and acceptance of invitations.

Each permission is attached to a logical partition in Shield called Namespace.

#### Namespace

A Namespace in Shield is a logical container or partitioning mechanism that helps organize and manage resources and access control policies. It is used to group related entities and define the scope of authorization within a system. With the namespaces we compartmentalize and control access to different parts of the application or system, allowing more granular authorization and improved security.

Each namespace can have its own set of permissions, roles, and access control policies, enabling fine-grained control over who can access what resources within the defined scope. For example, the namespace `app/organization` in Shield contains permissions related to managing organizations. These permissions could include `create` `update` `delete` `get` and so on.

### Predefined Org Permissions

Includes a list of Shield's predefined permissions at the organization level.

:::info
Shield allows inheritance of permissions for a hierarchical structure, where higher-level permissions grant access to lower-level entities. In this case, granting permissions at the organization level automatically extends those permissions to the projects, resources, and groups within that org.

Permissions in Shield follow a hierarchical structure, where higher-level permissions include the capabilities of lower-level permissions. For example, a higher-level permission like **adminiter** includes all the capabilities of a lower-level permission like **get**.

### Custom Permissions

Shield allow the its platform administrators (Superusers) to create permissions to meet specific authorization requirements beyond the predefined set of permissions. Custom permissions allow for more granular control over access to resources and actions within an application or system. They enable organizations to define and enforce fine-grained access policies tailored to their unique needs.

When creating custom permissions, administrators typically define the name and scope (namespace) of the permission. The name should be descriptive and indicative of the action or resource it governs. The scope determines where the permission applies, such as the platform(making it available across all the organizations in Shield), organization, project or group.

:::note
The permissions can either be created dynamically when the Shield is running, or can either be provided in the server configurations.
:::

For example, let's say you have an e-commerce application where users can manage their shopping carts. To control access to cart-related actions, you can create custom permissions in the **potato/cart** namespace.

Sample custom permission requirements:

| **Permission Name** | **Permission Title** | **Namespace** | **Description**                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **delete**          | Cart Delete          | potato/cart   | Grants the ability to delete items from the shopping cart. |
| **update**          | Cart Update          | potato/cart   | Allows updating the contents of the shopping cart.         |
| **get**             | Cart Get             | potato/cart   | Enables retrieving the details of the shopping cart.       |

This is how the [resource config file](https://github.com/raystack/shield/blob/7cae6bf86e99fe96650c6dcd4e8207cb916b8184/test/e2e/smoke/testdata/resource/potato.yaml#L4) will look like

:::info
While creating permissions, it is important to note that the namespace is appended to the permission name to generate a permission slug. For instance, the **delete** permission name will be appended with namespace **potato/cart**, to generate the final permission slug as **potato_cart_delete** in Shield. This naming convention is used to ensure uniqueness and organization of permissions within Shield. While creating a role, we pass the list of these permission slugs being binded to that role.

## Managing Permission

There are two ways to check a user permission on a resource in shield,

## API Interface

<Tabs groupId="api">
  <TabItem value="HTTP" label="HTTP" default>
        <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
    {`$ curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8000/v1beta1/check'
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
--header 'Accept: application/json'
--header 'X-Shield-Email: doe.john@raystack.org'
--data-raw '{
  "objectId": "test-resource-beta1",
  "objectNamespace": "entropy/firehose",
  "permission": "owner"
}'`}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Proxy Middleware

Users can add middleware in the rules set to check permission. Middlewares will be called before the proxy call and will not call the services if authorization fails.

The shield will read the action from the config, resource id from the path params, and UserId of the current user.

```yaml
- name: test-res
  path: /test-res
  target: "http://127.0.0.1:3000/"
  methods: ["PUT"]
  frontends:
    - name: test_api
      path: "/test-res/{resource_id}"
      method: "PUT"
      middlewares:
        - name: authz
          config:
            actions:
              - test-res_all_actions
              - test-res_cancel
            attributes:
              project:
                key: X-Shield-Project
                type: header
                source: request
```
