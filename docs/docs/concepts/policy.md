# Policy

A Policy in Shield represents a binding between a principal (user or group) to a single role. It establishes a relationship that grants specific permissions or access rights to a principal. These policies are used to define who has what level of access within a system or resource in an Organization.

> A role is a named list of permissions; each role can be a predefined role or a user-created custom role.
