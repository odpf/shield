# Policy

A Policy in Shield refers to the set of rules that determine who can access what resources and perform which actions. It represents a binding between a principal (user or group) to a single role. It establishes a relationship that grants specific permissions or access rights to a principal. Policies are critical in organizations as they ensure security, compliance with regulations, and adherence to best practices.

> A role is a named list of permissions; each role can be a predefined role or a user-created custom role.
